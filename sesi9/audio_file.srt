And I'm Phil. How?

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,000
Ooh, you look like you're in painful. Are you okay?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,600
I'll be okay. I hurt myself playing football, but I'm sure I can tough it out.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,800
Tough it out. Are you sure you can, Phil?

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,800
Anyway, that's a great phrase to learn. What does tough it out mean?

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,600
If you tough it out, then you work through a painful or difficult situation.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,600
You stay strong and don't change your plans.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,200
And it's not just for physical pains like yours.

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,000
We can use it for difficult situations.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,400
For example, you might be working for a company that can't afford to employ enough people

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,400
and you just have to tough it out until they've got some more money.

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,400
Let's hear some other people using this phrase.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,400
I am so hungry.

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:07,200
I didn't have any time for breakfast, but I'm going to have to tough it out until my lunch break.

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh no, there's no hot water and I really need a shower.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,600
I'm going to have to tough it out.

19
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,800
Oh, there's no air conditioning in this building. I'm absolutely boiling.

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,200
I guess I'll just have to tough it out.

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:30,000
We've been learning the phrase tough it out to mean work through a difficult situation

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,600
and not let it stop you.

23
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,400
As a phrase, we always put it in the middle between tough and out.

24
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:44,800
Now, it originally comes from the phrasal verb tough something out and you can tough something out or tough out something.

25
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,800
Yes, it can be hard to learn phrasal verbs, but if you tough it out, you'll get there.

Hello and welcome to the English we speak, where we explain phrases used by fluent English speakers

00:06.400 --> 00:09.600
so that you can use them too. I'm Feifei.

00:09.600 --> 00:11.800
And I'm Phil. How?

00:11.800 --> 00:15.000
Ooh, you look like you're in painful. Are you okay?

00:15.000 --> 00:20.600
I'll be okay. I hurt myself playing football, but I'm sure I can tough it out.

00:20.600 --> 00:23.800
Tough it out. Are you sure you can, Phil?

00:23.800 --> 00:28.800
Anyway, that's a great phrase to learn. What does tough it out mean?

00:28.800 --> 00:33.600
If you tough it out, then you work through a painful or difficult situation.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.600
You stay strong and don't change your plans.

00:36.600 --> 00:40.200
And it's not just for physical pains like yours.

00:40.200 --> 00:43.000
We can use it for difficult situations.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.400
For example, you might be working for a company that can't afford to employ enough people

00:48.400 --> 00:52.400
and you just have to tough it out until they've got some more money.

00:52.400 --> 00:55.400
Let's hear some other people using this phrase.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.400
I am so hungry.

01:01.400 --> 01:07.200
I didn't have any time for breakfast, but I'm going to have to tough it out until my lunch break.

01:07.200 --> 01:12.000
Oh no, there's no hot water and I really need a shower.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.600
I'm going to have to tough it out.

01:14.600 --> 01:18.800
Oh, there's no air conditioning in this building. I'm absolutely boiling.

01:18.800 --> 01:21.200
I guess I'll just have to tough it out.

01:21.200 --> 01:30.000
We've been learning the phrase tough it out to mean work through a difficult situation

01:30.000 --> 01:32.600
and not let it stop you.

01:32.600 --> 01:37.400
As a phrase, we always put it in the middle between tough and out.

01:37.400 --> 01:44.800
Now, it originally comes from the phrasal verb tough something out and you can tough something out or tough out something.

01:44.800 --> 01:50.800
